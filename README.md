 # **Job Recommendation System for Data Science Jobs in Helsinki**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a **data-driven job recommendation system** that helps data science professionals find relevant job opportunities in the **Helsinki area**. By scraping job postings from **LinkedIn**, the system analyzes current hiring trends, demand for specific skills, and market insights. The application is built using **Streamlit** for interactive visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Additionally, it matches applicants with suitable job postings based on their **skills and experience** using **NLP techniques** and **TF-IDF cosine similarity**.  

## **Key Features**  

✅ **Job Data Collection** – Scrapes LinkedIn job postings for **Data science jobs market trends** and hiring patterns.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyzes job descriptions to identify **in-demand skills**, required experience levels, and industry trends.  
✅ **Skill-Based Job Recommendation System** – Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to match job descriptions with an applicant’s skills and experience.  
✅ **Interactive Dashboard** – Built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to filter and explore job postings, skill trends, and salary insights.  

## **Tech Stack**  

- **Python** – Data processing, NLP, and model building  
- **Apify Web Scrapper** – Web scraping from LinkedIn  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning and analysis  
- **Scikit-learn & NLP Techniques** – Job matching using **TF-IDF vectorization & cosine similarity**  
- **Streamlit** – Interactive UI for job visualization and recommendations  
- **Plotly,Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization for market trends  

## **How It Works**  

1. **Scraping Data** – The system collects job postings from **LinkedIn** , extracting relevant fields such as job title, company, required skills, and location.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyzes the demand for different skills, trends in job postings, and insights into the **Helsinki data science job market**.  
3. **Job Recommendation Engine** – Uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity** to compare job descriptions with a user’s skill set, ranking jobs based on relevance.  
4. **Streamlit Web App** – Provides an intuitive dashboard where users can explore trends and receive job recommendations tailored to their profiles.  

## **Future Enhancements**  

- Implementing **deep learning-based embeddings (BERT, Word2Vec)** for improved job matching accuracy.  
- Expanding to include **more job sources** (e.g., Indeed, Glassdoor).  
- Adding a **salary prediction model** based on historical data.
