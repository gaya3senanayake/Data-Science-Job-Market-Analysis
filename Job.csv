We are a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've released six games globally ‚Äì Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale, Brawl Stars, and Squad Busters.

To make six games, we've killed dozens along the way. That's because we're obsessed with quality. Our mission is to create great games that as many people as possible play for years and that are remembered forever. To achieve this goal, we put together the best possible teams and give them the freedom and independence to succeed.

You Might Love It Here...

If you love games, Supercell is the place for you. We're made up of proactive, independent teams that have the freedom to do what they think is best for their players, our games, and the company.

We know it takes more than trust and independence to make great games, so we also take good care of our people, providing them with the compensation, work environment and resources they need to succeed and have fun while at it.

This position is in Helsinki, but you're not?

Luckily, moving to Helsinki is easier than you might think. No matter where you would be moving from, our dedicated people will help you from beginning to end. We're here to ensure the process is as smooth as possible for you, your family and whoever and whatever you bring along. In addition to cats and dogs, we've even relocated a horse.

This is a general selection process for software engineers focused on virtualisation and container technology - from the kernel through userspace. Apply here if you are an exceptional Go, Rust, or C/C++ software engineer and want to work on next-generation open source VMM or container technology, or related open source networking and storage.

Container, virtualisation and cloud infrastructure have become essentials of modern software deployments. We invest in open source related to application isolation, workload orchestration, system or OCI containers, micro service architecture or cloud infrastructure.

Here are some examples of projects under way at Canonical.

RustVMM has great potential as a new hypervisor for Linux. We are building a team to work on this, with an emphasis on performance, security and operability. Work in Rust and bring your expert knowledge of VMM and related kernel networking and storage capabilities.

Docker images are easy to make and publish on Docker Hub and other registries, but the quality, consistency and security maintenance of those images is broadly very poor. Canonical is in a good position to publish a portfolio of outstanding Docker images.

Apply here if you are an exceptional software engineer who prefers to work in Rust. After the first round of interviews we'll find the best fit product team at Canonical for you to progress your application based on your personal interests.

At the large scale of the Wolt business, our operational efficiency benefits greatly from having automation for managing supply (how many courier partners are online) and demand (how many orders are being placed by customers). For us supply balance is a clear win-win situation, but it takes an entire team to make sure that this is possible. üí™ To succeed even better with supply balance, we are adding one more Backend Engineer to our new Supply and Demand team!

Supply and Demand team‚Äôs mission is to make Wolt cities efficient for our customers, merchants and couriers, as well as making running the cities smooth for our operations people. This is done by building tools and features that help achieve balance between supply (number of Courier Partners online) and demand (home delivery orders from consumers) by surfacing the forecasts to our Courier Partners in the Courier App and Wolt operations, as well as creating ways to dynamically influence supply and demand. As a backend engineer you will have a chance to work on topics around, for example, courier engagement and activation bonuses. That can be fun and rewarding for several reasons:


 * This field encourages innovative approaches and experimentation. You can try out new methodologies to see what works best.
 * You often collaborate with various teams such as applied science, analytics, product management, and operations.
 * Designing systems to optimize courier activation and bonuses involves solving complex logistics and machine learning problems.
 * The need for real-time solutions means you often work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
   
   

At the moment, the team consists of two frontend developers, several backend engineers and applied scientists as well as the engineering team lead and product lead. The main programming languages on the team are Python, Scala, and TypeScript (React) and since the team also works closely with Applied Scientists, this is a great chance to learn a lot about machine learning if you have a knack for it!

This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Stockholm, or Berlin or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, or Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here.

Our humble expectations

üëâ You have solid experience designing, building, and integrating quality software (microservices) in Scala on a large scale within a complex domain, with strong focus on event-driven approach where the decisions need to be made in an online way.

üëâ You have knowledge of AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, observability (DataDog or similar tools) and data storage, both SQL and noSQL databases. We are actively using multiple solutions: postgresql, dynamodb, mongo, redis.

üëâ You‚Äôre a dedicated person who is pragmatic with a positive attitude, who doesn't shy away from going outside of their comfort zone, and demonstrates curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.

üëâ You‚Äôre comfortable working with real-world data and its different nuances.

So, TL;DR if you have several years of experience in dealing with the back end of the house, can‚Äôt wait to learn new things, have an interest in tackling scalability challenges and building some cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line! üì´

Would you like to be a part of Recordly's story? Now is your chance! We‚Äôre looking for a Machine Learning Engineer eager to help businesses capitalize on the opportunities data and machine learning offer. Working at Recordly means you get to work with customers that truly want to make data and ML/AI their competitive edge.




‚ÄúWHO/WHAT IS RECORDLY?‚Äù YOU MIGHT ASK

Recordly is an independent Futurice family company specializing in value creation for our customers with data solutions. We believe a significant data transformation is taking place, but many companies are facing challenges in actualizing its full potential. We are here to help.




Our mission is to define the way data and people cooperate. We want to support businesses in understanding the data they already have, the business opportunities data possesses they‚Äôre not yet realizing, and how to use these to enhance strategic KPIs. Simultaneously, we aim to translate business requirements into actionable tasks for teams working with the data or related technologies. Through this collaboration with our customers, we aspire to drive and accelerate a broader data transformation movement.




In more traditional terms, our core business is data management, data architectures, and hands-on data engineering that enable exceptional user experiences, efficiency gains, AI solutions, and new business models. We also get our hands dirty with streaming ML, GenAI, or building enterprise-level ML platforms. In simple terms, we tech the heck out of data. What sets us apart is who we are and how we do it.




Our employee promise (besides offering engaging customer assignments, of course) includes the possibility to enjoy the company's success and shape who we are and what we do, together. We believe in being open about how the business is going and how the choices we make affect the bottom line. Take a look at our site to get to know us better.




NOW TO THE ROLE ITSELF

A Machine Learning Engineer at Recordly typically works in tight cooperation with very skilled colleagues and our customers within different assignments. Assignments vary and typically require hands-on work from time to time - meaning you may have to open up AWS/Azure/GCP Console and deploy some machine learning resources or write some MLOps stuff or data pipelines when the Data Engineers are not around. As we focus on creating actual business value by creating or utilizing for example data and machine learning platforms, we value the following skills:




 * Technical skills, both verbal and written, along with the ability to influence and demonstrate confidence in communications with data and machine learning technologies such as
 * Fluent with cloud infrastructure, especially the data side of the big three. We don‚Äôt expect you to be certified (we can help you with that), but work experience at least within one of the big three is needed.
 * Python - Yeah. This is our main tool in development. Knowledge of other languages is considered an advantage. Of course.
 * MLOps concepts and tool(s) - The most important part of your job is to build the capabilities to enable productive machine learning solutions. We believe that MLOps and other <Dev/Data>Ops methods are an important part of that.
 * Basic knowledge of machine learning models - It‚Äôs important to make business value using various machine learning models. To ensure this, a basic understanding of how the models work is sufficient, but even more important is an interest in how the models are operated in a production environment.
 * Understanding and/or experience with Data Lake infrastructure, Data Warehousing, and Data Analytics tools. By this we mean, that you know what other tools (MDM, Data Catalogs, Data Lineage tools etc.) are needed for a good data platform and have some experience with those.
 * Ability to understand and translate business requirements into data and machine learning technical requirements. And we truly mean this. We want to be the glue, bridge, sellotape - whatever you want to call it - between the IT and business departments so that they understand each other.
 * Finnish and English skills as some of our projects are in Finnish.




WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU

When you join Recordly, you‚Äôll be greeted by our open culture and awesome colleagues. On the more tangible side, we both want you to be able to pay your bills and take good care of yourself. We do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach. Therefore, we have introduced a pimp my benefits plan to make sure you get the most out of your benefits. Pick and choose what benefits you want to prioritise! In addition to the pimp my benefits offering, a great common baseline of benefits is offered to all employees.

High Precision GNSS Algorithm Engineer




The Job

Our High Precision GNSS Algorithm Engineer designs, implements and validates our state-of-the-art embedded positioning and navigation software. This software runs on GNSS and hybrid navigation modules capable of centimeter-level-precision positioning. As an algorithm engineer, you‚Äôre part of our PNT Products development team.

Your mission

As High Precision GNSS Algorithm Engineer, you are a key contributor to the development of Septentrio next generation Positioning Engine. The Positioning Engine computes centimeter level position, cm/s velocity and sub-degree orientation based on GNSS ranges coupled with additional sensors such as accelerometers, gyros, a magnetometer, and an odometer.

You work closely with peer Software Engineers and GNSS Algorithms Experts to develop high quality software in C++, running efficiently on a state-of-the-art embedded platform and will ensure the flexibility, modularity and efficiency of the object-oriented software implementation starting from Matlab and/or C++ prototypes.

You develop unit tests and software test cases to validate your algorithms and software, leveraging the Septentrio library of real test data and the continuous integration framework.

Your qualifications

You have at least four years of hands-on experience in cm-level GNSS positioning, gained either in the industry or through academic research. You hold a MSc or PhD in geomatics, geodesy, aerospace engineering, mathematics, or a related field.

We value individuals who are proactive, structured, and analytical problem-solvers. You should enjoy working closely with a small team of specialists, where collaboration is key to our success.

While not mandatory, experience working in Agile/Scrum teams, knowledge of ambiguity resolution algorithms, and programming skills in Matlab and Python will give you an edge in this position.

 * A flat organization and plenty of room for your ideas

About us

think-cell is a fast-paced software company in Berlin, Germany, with a focus on developing graphics products that stand out from the crowd. More than 1,000,000 users worldwide rely on our software for their daily business because we make creating PowerPoint presentations so much easier, faster, and more enjoyable. Among our customers are many renowned consulting companies and large international corporations.

Because think-cell is highly profitable, we do not have to make compromises regarding code quality and beauty. We are willing to go the extra mile in developing sophisticated algorithms and refining our user interface, and we are proud of our many happy customers. The company is owned and managed by seasoned computer scientists, which contributes to a working environment that makes exceptional Developers want to come and stay.




About our software

Our focus is on business slides (as opposed to more artful, open-ended applications) because they offer great potential for automation of the layout tasks traditionally performed by PowerPoint users themselves. There are plenty of challenges, from a solid understanding of what makes a good layout, to algorithms that produce an aesthetically pleasing output fast enough for interactive slide design, to an intuitive and unobtrusive graphical user interface that supports our original approach to slide layout, to solid technical solutions for automatic bug reporting and updates, to compatibility with third-party software on the computers of over a million users.




Here are some highlights of what we have done:




Language

 * Everything we do is C++. Even our customer portal is written in C++. There is some Assembler glue code where necessary, and our build scripts are written in Python, but other than that, think-cell is all about C++.
 * We closely track the latest versions of our compilers, Visual C++ and Xcode, so we can always use the latest C++ standard features as soon as they become available.
 * We fund the working group for programming languages of the German Institute for Standardization (DIN). Some of our employees are members of this committee and vote in the international standardization process ISO / IEC C++.
 * We are also an official sponsor of the Standard C++ Foundation, which promotes international standards for C++.




Library

 * We use Boost throughout our code, e.g., Boost.Spirit for parsing.
 * We have our own range library, in the same spirit as Boost.Range or Eric Niebler‚Äôs range-v3, but going further, for example, by unifying internal and external iteration. We gave a talk about it, and most of the code is public.
 * We develop our own cross-platform library to support macOS and Windows with a single code base.
 * We have our own reference-counting and persistence libraries to save and restore whole object trees.
 * We have an extensive bug reporting infrastructure. Assertions and error checks stay in the release code, and our software automatically reports bugs to our server. The server analyzes the bug, categorizes it and files it in a database that all Developers can access. If an update fixes the bug, the user can download the update directly from a bug response web page.




Algorithms

 * think-cell was founded on the idea for an algorithm for automatic slide layout, and we are still on an exciting journey towards that ambitious vision. You can see our most recent release in action!
 * We developed a new algorithm for automatic point cloud labeling that allows labels to be positioned away from the actual points.
 * We developed a new algorithm for automatic column chart labeling.
 * We are working with John Forrest ‚Äì author of the linear solver CLP ‚Äì to make his simplex code faster for our kinds of problems.
 * We developed many generic data structures that are not in C++ or Boost, such as partitions.
 * Our software not only produces charts, it can also read them off print and digital images. For our chart recognition tool, we rely on OpenCV and the Leptonica Image Processing Library.




Reverse Engineering

 * We do lots of reverse engineering with the disassembler IDA from Hex-Rays, to achieve things that are not possible via the documented Microsoft Office API.
 * We have probably written the best function hooking engine out there. Each time our software starts, we patch the Microsoft Office executables in memory. Rather than hard-coding patch addresses, we search for small chunks of assembly code to protect against minor changes in the executables.




About this job

We're looking for bright, creative Developers with a solid theoretical background. Our team‚Äôs backgrounds range from 10+ years of commercial experience in various fields to fresh graduates in Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics. A university degree or work experience with C++, in combination with a fresh and creative problem-solving approach, would be ideal for this role. We love working with talented people, whether you're a student, fresh graduate, or C++ expert, therefore our recruitment process is skills-based and consists of tasks related to the role.




You will mostly work independently and will be responsible for the whole range of tasks involved in implementing a new feature. You should be able to look at a problem from the user's perspective and discuss abstract concepts with fellow Developers. We expect each of our Developers to do architecture, design, implementation, customer feedback and bug fixing, rather than splitting these activities between several people. We thus put everyone in control of their own work.




At think-cell, there are no deadlines or scheduled meetings. A feature is ready to be released when you are convinced that you have implemented the best possible solution. Meetings take place as needed, and only the people actually involved in the topic are required to attend. At any time in the process, ideas, suggestions and criticism from anybody in the hierarchy are welcome and are seriously considered. We want to hear your ideas, even if they mean that we have to change a lot of code to make things better.




We have published several scientific articles in the areas of artificial intelligence and computer graphics, and we will encourage you to do the same. We sponsor visits to conferences and have close relationships with universities and research institutes across the U.S. and Germany.




think-cell encourages a healthy work-life balance. We do not work at night or on weekends.




We pay very competitive salaries and offer our Developers EUR 130,000 annually after one year of employment. If necessary, we will go out of our way to help you relocate to Berlin, and we will do what we can to help you acquire a work permit. You should be able to communicate effectively in English. Knowing German is not required, but we will arrange and cover to costs of German lessons, if desired.",Entry level,https://fi.linkedin.com/jobs/view/c%2B%2B-developer-f-m-d-in-berlin-and-remote-130-000-eur-per-year-at-think-cell-software-4005355561?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,"Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland",3 weeks ago,,,2024-08-22,,Software Development and IT Services and IT Consulting,C++ Developer (f/m/d) in Berlin and REMOTE 130 000 EUR per year,Information Technology,Hybrid,,,en,"C++, Powerpoint, SAS, C, Access, Python, R",Unknown,Unknown,"RDS, Glue",problem-solving,26-50,Large-Scale,Helsinki,"Uusimaa, Finland",3.0,4w,08,['Developer'],C f m d Berlin REMOTE 130 000 EUR per year,"['C', 'f', 'm', 'd', 'Berlin', 'REMOTE', '130', '000', 'EUR', 'per', 'year']",['Information Technology']

Founded 10 years' ago, this collection of data experts are challenging the way consultancies are viewed across the market. Yes, they are solving their customer's problems within data, but they're doing this in a unique and consultant-centric way.

The founders came together with a vision to look at the customer as whole and create bespoke data platforms that solved multiple issues, in a way that leveraged modern techniques and methodologies. They have since grown to around 100 people; people isn't the correct term, subject matter experts is more fitting!

It's been important to them from day one to create an environment that cultivates experts and allows like-minded data enthusiasts to share ideas and work on interesting projects.

How do they do this?


 * Working in teams to deliver an entire data platform (infrastructure included), always in the cloud and with cutting-edge tech
 * Microsoft Gold Partner, therefore working closely with Microsoft to support key customers and early access to the newest technologies
 * Specialist teams that cover the build, infra, advisory, ML/AI and integration
 * Nurturing an entrepreneurial environment where new ideas and are encouraged with a real ownership over your projects and development
   
   

Due to their incredible strong customer network and project pipeline, they're always looking for new colleagues who get excited about the opportunity to become an SME within Data.

What kind of skills and attributes do they get excited about?


 * Strong experience building out data platforms with responsibilities in datawarehousing, ETL, modelling, integration, security and processing: Ideally this looks like 3+ years' experience but it's more about what you've done than necessarily the number of years you've done it for
 * Proficiency in Azure: Particular experience within Data Factory, Fabric, Databricks, Synapse and/or SQL - you should at least have a solid base knowledge in cloud, but have a real desire to become an expert
 * Skilled in working with databases: Both on prem and in the cloud
 * A keen interest to constantly learn more and up-skill: These consultants are regarded and some of the best in Finland, and they've got there by consistently improving their knowledge and leveraging new technologies
 * Strong communication skills: Demonstrated through managing and engaging stakeholders to consult and translate business requirements effectively - acting as bridge
 * Ability to work independently and part of a team: You will deliver as a team but you should have the know how and confidence to take the initiatives and bring your ideas to the table - there is a great platform you to take ownership
 * Fluency in Finnish is required
   
   

As you can see from the above, this is a fantastic opportunity to join genuinely one of the best consulting companies in Finland (arguable the Nordics as they begin their further expansion).

Alongside the above they have a highly competitive salary and benefits package; happy to go into details on their set-up but after speaking with consultants who work there, it's the people, projects and potential to progress that really makes this company stand out.

As of today, we manage a complex observability stack, covering a wide scope from application instrumentation and telemetry data collection to visualization and alerting, spanning both backend and client-facing applications. Our daily responsibilities ensure that this ecosystem operates seamlessly. In parallel, we're building the next-generation observability platform, re-architecting our stack and pipelines in collaboration with our counterparts at DoorDash. This partnership provides an unparalleled opportunity to drive high-impact initiatives across the observability domain, offering empowerment and involvement in cutting-edge projects.

 * Apply your expertise in SRE culture and practices to ensure observability has a meaningful impact on our business.
 * Participate in the on-call rotation to address incidents and outages, resolving reliability issues efficiently.
 * Help standardize observability resources by building tools and documentation that enhance productivity and developer experience.
 * Triage and resolve production issues within the observability scope.
 * Contribute to open-source efforts by sharing some of our internal tools with the broader community.
   
   

Our humble expectations:


 * Proven experience in Software Engineering, SRE, or a similar role with a focus on observability, reliability, and scaling large systems.
 * Strong foundation in computer science principles and engineering fundamentals.
 * Proficient in development, particularly in Go (preferred) or Python, with experience building automation tools and software for large-scale, distributed systems.
 * Hands-on experience with observability tooling such as DataDog, Prometheus, Mimir, Elasticsearch, Grafana, Jaeger, and tracing systems.
 * Expertise in cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure, with experience managing cloud infrastructure using Kubernetes and containers (Docker).
 * Deep knowledge of building and maintaining reliable, high-performance, and scalable distributed systems.
 * Solid understanding of SRE principles, incident response, and designing fault-tolerant architectures.
 * Experience with infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or Ansible for managing cloud environments.
 * Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and continuous delivery practices.
 * Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with experience troubleshooting complex distributed systems.
 * Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work cross-functionally to enhance platform observability and reliability.
 * Experience working directly with development teams, with a willingness to dive into application code for observability-related topics, even when unfamiliar with the application code.
 * Solid experience with Docker and Kubernetes, coupled with a strong foundation in Unix systems and networking concepts.
 * Open to feedback, recognizing that no one is perfect‚Äîincluding us. We see feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow together.
   
   

Nice to Haves:


 * You have experience with OpenTelemetry, which is a key foundation for much of the infrastructure and tooling the team is converging on as part of our future observability strategy.
 * You have experience with handling data and running monitoring infrastructure at scale, such as managing petabyte-scale Elasticsearch clusters or similar databases
 * You have experience operating distributed event streaming platforms at scale e.g. Apache Kafka
 * Open-source contributions in observability, cloud, or platform engineering are a strong plus

 * Streamlining the packaging and distribution of particularly troublesome third-party components for optimal experience by end users
 * Developing new means to deliver Ubuntu Linux at scale to the strict quality standards and delivery schedules expected by end users
   
   

While not a formal managerial role, the successful candidate will possess strong people skills and natural ability to lead engineers within the team, as well as working with other external teams to coordinate adoption and delivery.

Location: We have home-based lead kernel roles in every timezone, although the individual aspects as listed above may be linked to a specific geographic region.

What your day will look like


 * Set the technical direction and lead the delivery of a team of junior and mid-career engineers for a key aspect of Ubuntu Linux
 * Work closely with management within and outside the team to track and coordinate initiatives to delivery
 * Collaborate daily with other senior technical leadership on the Kernel Team on how best to ensure Ubuntu stays at the pinnacle of Linux distributions
   
   

What we are looking for in you


 * Well-organised and motivated self-starter able to thrive in a remote work environment
 * Strong communication skills in English, both written and verbal
 * Expert understanding of the C programming language
 * Demonstrated expertise working in a *nix-based operating system kernel and distribution. While direct Linux experience would be ideal, it is not mandatory.
 * Python and Bash scripting ability
 * Powerful grasp of the capabilities and nuances of the git version control system
 * Ability to travel internationally at least twice a year for company events of up to two weeks length
   
   

Additional skills that you might also bring

 * Strong grasp of device drivers, BSP's, and other low level system engineering
   
   

What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.


 * Home-based work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
 * Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year

With a robust understanding of Node.js, you'll have the opportunity to enhance our technical stack and ensure consistent delivery of high-quality solutions.

Regular interactions with cross-functional teams will keep you engaged and aligned with ongoing and upcoming projects.

What success looks like during your first 6 months in the role

Your journey begins with getting familiar with our infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines, and supporting daily operations within the first 1-2 months. By 3-4 months, you'll be proposing enhancements for scalability, security, and performance. In 5-6 months, you'll lead pivotal initiatives, such as refining disaster recovery plans and optimizing monitoring systems.

Your closest colleagues

You'll work closely with our existing DevOps engineer, and regularly engage with product teams. Your role will require clear communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to ensure alignment and smooth execution of projects.

Goals and metrics

Your success will be measured by maintaining system uptime, improving deployment speeds, and achieving project milestones efficiently. Key performance indicators will include timely project delivery, and the successful implementation of security practices.

We are looking for experienced Senior Software Engineers who can develop production-level microservices in Kotlin, to join several different Engineering Groups at Wolt.

Our Engineering organization at Wolt consists of 700+ Engineers working across 70+ product teams. Some of us work on the visible parts, making our services easy on the eye and some of us focus on the unseen magic happening behind the scenes. ‚ú®

Our Engineers handle the whole development process (business logic, testing, database & data streaming, CI/CD, analytics, cloud) in an autonomous manner. They build things that are accessible and made to scale. They keep our systems in the best shape by simplifying the unnecessary complexity.

We make the decisions as a team and group of teams for our ways of working and we take architectural decisions together. Everyone plays a role in our future.

Our Engineers choose the best technologies that work for Wolt, their teams and themselves. Making good choices means finding scalable, robust technology that works in everyone‚Äôs best interests. The freedom to experiment and adopt the best technology benefits everyone.

The main stack for these roles consists for example Kotlin (Ktor, Koin, Spring, grpc‚Ä¶), PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka, Redis, GitHub Actions, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.

Needless to say, in such an environment there‚Äôs a lot of room for learning, teaching and growing together!

Go ahead and check our Kotlin related Tech Talks below.

FinTech Group: dedicated to shaping the future of financial services at Wolt. üöÄ Our Fintech teams play a critical role in enabling smooth and automated money flows for our customers, merchants, and courier partners as well as delivering financial products to them. To meet local requirements and provide the best financial solutions, our Fintech engineering teams are at the forefront of building integrations and automating financial processes for local country teams, supporting expansion in our existing markets and into new ones.

We currently have multiple roles in our Fintech Teams, and depending on your experience, we will make sure to find the right team for you if you love working with modern technologies like Kotlin, are always open to learning new things, find motivation in working with skilled and nice colleagues, and don't shy away from highly challenging engineering topics, you'll fit right in! üí°üë©‚Äçüíª

Merchant Integrations: Running a restaurant or a store while fulfilling delivery orders is hard work that can be made easy with automation. This is where our integration platform comes in. We help our merchant partners automate the manual work with our API and integration offerings. Once a merchant has these integrations in place, their staff are free to do what they do best - service consumers without being bogged down by mundane, repetitive, and error prone manual processes. Through our API platform, we ensure that the experience for our partners is best in class, making it a breeze to work with Wolt. Be it orders going to POS (Point of Sale) systems automatically, venue management, item & inventory control, menu & catalog automation, our teams have our merchants covered!

Merchant Operations: In recent years, we started expanding our delivery offering to new verticals beyond restaurant deliveries, including grocery, pharmacy, merchandise, flowers, and apparel, all referred to as ‚ÄúRetail‚Äù. That meant quite many new services and technical improvements as use cases and flows are more complex than ever. Our Merchant Operations subgroup consists of 4 different teams full of smart engineers creating new solutions to enhance our operational abilities with Merchants. Here, we build merchant applications that help merchants run their day-to-day operations. We also build all the relevant tooling from Product Catalog to Offer Management systems to make sure we can capture the full assortment of the merchants in the easiest way possible.

Merchant Engagement: Engagement focuses on Acquiring more quality Merchants and reducing the time and effort it takes to onboard them so they can make their first sales on Wolt. The group also aims to make best-in-industry self-service experiences for onboarding & Imaging, a unified Merchant portal where you can get everything you need done, and insights dashboard to help maximize business performance

Retail Platforms (Wolt Market): Last year we took a leap forward with a dedicated product offering for Wolt Market - Retail Platforms. Wolt Market is a chain of dark grocery stores available on Wolt‚Äôs well known delivery platform. Wolt Market delivers groceries to our users within 30 minutes. We successfully built from scratch several teams of talented Engineers, Product Leads and Designers building internal tooling within the areas like warehousing, assortment, catalog and pricing.

Consumer Group: As the name Consumer Group implies, we are responsible for building and developing Wolt‚Äôs consumer-facing products. Our mission is to master the user experience while scaling up the platform to enable delivering a mall in your pocket. We‚Äôre humbled and proud to say our apps have the industry‚Äôs highest ratings in the App Store (4.8) and Google Play (4.6). We believe that a great user experience enables healthy top-line growth. We make sure our users find the right content from the platform and convert. We are here in the long term by retaining our customers and keeping them engaged. Currently, the Consumer Group is growing especially in the front of AdTech and Search functions making sure we succeed in the above-mentioned mission.

üìçThese open roles can be based in all of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Stockholm, or Berlin. This can vary depending on the exact team and their main location. You can choose whether you want to work from home, from the office or hybrid.

Our humble expectations

We are looking for experienced Senior Software Engineers who can develop production-level microservices in Kotlin. We'd love to see experience with Kotlin or any other JVM backend languages like Java and Scala but encourage you to convince us about your learning abilities if you come from a different background. üõ†Ô∏è

As a member of our team, you'll dive into the world of microservices, primarily using Kotlin, while remaining open to exploring other modern languages, such as Python, in some teams. We appreciate previous experience in handling the whole development cycle all the way to production.

But what truly sets you apart is your ability to tackle big challenges together, envision scalability and availability, and dare to question conventional decisions. You‚Äôll be successful in our teams if you quickly grasp new concepts and thrive in an environment of continuous learning.üåü

We put a lot of focus on the ability to collaborate well with others. We work closely with our teammates and having a good connection with team members is essential. We understand that everyone has their own unique way of communicating with others. We expect you to be yourself, express your opinions, and work together with the rest of the team.

In addition to technical expertise, we cherish those who take ownership beyond the obvious, have an insatiable hunger for knowledge, make collaborative decisions, and enthusiastically collaborate with diverse teams Woltwide. We value the unique perspectives and skills you bring to our adventure, and we're excited to see what you can achieve with us!üë•üöÄ

Next Steps

We are hiring for a number of open Senior positions across a few different Engineering Groups. During the initial screening call our Talent Acquisition Partner will discuss with you your expectations and possible domain preferences as well as share more about different teams. After the recruiter screening call, the interviewing steps are conducted for a particular group in mind, with a specific team being proposed at the end of the process - that‚Äôs the moment when you‚Äôll latest get to meet your possible Team Lead. Throughout the process, we will do our best to match your experience, skills and aspirations with the most suitable Engineering team at Wolt!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

Doublepoint creates gesture recognition software for smartwatches. Our technologies are being used to control AR/VR, IoT, wearables, automotive, AI assistants, TVs, and much more. Our smartwatch algorithms detect subtle hand gestures and need to be accurate, responsive, low power, and generalizable across populations. We're a small team of 15 people based mostly in Helsinki, with 6m euro in funding from VCs and angels, and our technology is being used by over 65k people today.

The team and the role

At Doublepoint, we need to collect a significant amount of high-quality data in order to train world-class gesture detection models.

At the core of this is our Data Infrastructure team, which builds tools to allow the User Research team to collect a lot of targeted data easily, as well as tooling to enable the Machine Learning team to access this data seamlessly for training models.

To support this work, we're looking for a dynamic full-stack engineer to join our Data Infrastructure team to help us develop and maintain modern data infra, as well as build tooling for people across the company to access our data and derive valuable insights from it.

While we are the owners of our main data stores and the pipelines going in and out of them, our responsibilities extend beyond that, and include full-stack projects that involve building UIs for collecting data and interfacing with our hardware (Doublepoint Kit), managing and tracking data collection, visualizing model performance, creating automations, as well as enabling anyone in the company to access and run aggregations on raw data to inform decisions.

This means we're looking for someone dynamic, who's able and willing to jump into different projects and enjoys doing so. There is also the possibility to specialize within the team and become an owner of larger pieces of our infrastructure, but at the same time we'd like you to be able to contribute to different areas.

 * Experience as a full-stack engineer shipping things to production with relevant technologies
 * We mostly use Python (Flask) and TypeScript (React) and would prefer direct experience with these but experience with other equivalent stacks is also valid
 * Having worked with relational databases at a reasonable scale in production
 * Having solid knowledge of SQL
 * Experience with setting up and managing services using established cloud providers (e.g. AWS)
 * Great communication. Our team operates async and it's important that we communicate effectively - particularly in written form - and document things. Most of our work happens in the Helsinki office, but not all!
   
   

Nice to have


 * Having managed a relational database like Postgres in production
 * Experience setting up automations using CI/CD tools
 * Experience managing and overseeing high-availability production servers and clusters
 * Our services stack includes Grafana, Sentry, Metabase, Cloudfare, PostHog, GitLab, AWS, and Fly.io. Extensive experience with any of these is a bonus.

We are on a mission to help retailers and consumer brands accelerate their growth by making smarter data-driven marketing decisions. Sellforte is a Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) SaaS for marketing teams and agencies to holistically evaluate and improve the effectiveness of marketing and promotional activities.

We are not a company that only shows cool marketing metrics or fancy dashboards ‚Äì we deliver real impact based on Bayesian methods and data science. For example, check out the video below how C&A's Analytics Director Gina de Ryck and Marketing Director Dr. Maik Kleinschmidt use Sellforte as an integral tool in their teams to improve marketing performance.

Serving modern data-driven marketing leaders like Gina and Maik, we have grown rapidly, and we have an ambitious plan to continue growing the company to new markets. It is an exciting opportunity also due to the current bigger developments in the marketing industry, where new privacy norms are eradicating measurement by user-level attribution, and probabilistic and econometric solutions like Sellforte are expected to gain ground.

You will join a team of roughly fifteen bad-ass data scientists, who are the spine for our business, and you‚Äôll work closely with many experts from various fields (for example Customer Success Managers, Software Developers, Sales). In addition, you'll get the chance to work with smaller and bigger marketers and consumer brands and make a real impact in their marketing by offering insights based on the data and modelling.

 * Do exploratory data analysis with customer data (using e.g. Python and pandas), solve customer-specific issues and business problems.
 * Help onboard new customers to our marketing analytics service/platform: set up data flow from customer to Sellforte, configure the modelling, and communicate technical solutions to customers.
 * Meet customers, e.g. in weekly/monthly meetings.
 * Participate in product development: communicate new learnings and insights, as well as develop new features and automation directly to the product.
 * Collaborate with other data scientists and data engineers to implement and train predictive machine learning models, such as time series forecasting Bayesian models to statistically infer causal impacts.
   
   

What we hope from you: üå§


 * Previous experience working as a data scientist, analytics consultant, or a similar role in the industry, having applied data analysis or ML/AI to real business problems.
 * Good communication skills in English. This is a customer facing role and it is crucial to be able to explain deeply technical issues to non-technical people.
 * Ability to identify and solve business problems based on data and quick analysis.‚ÄØPositive and get-things-done attitude in general.
 * Hands-on technical skills especially with Python.
 * We hope that you would already be located in the Helsinki/Espoo region in Finland, or you would be willing to relocate there. Relocation support to Finland is possible. For GDPR and contractual reasons, the job needs to be done within Europe.
   
   

üéØ‚ÄØWhat Sellforte offers to you:


 * Work in an open and easy-going startup/scaleup environment with nice colleagues üöÄ
 * International and multi-cultural team. We have 13+ different nationalities working in 5 different countries!
 * Globally‚ÄØunique product which is developed with modern technologies (such as Python, AWS, Airflow, Stan etc)
 * A low hierarchy and enjoyable ride. We try to find that extra spark of fun that makes the journey worthwhile to ourselves and to the people around us. Sellforteans are bunch of warm hearted and kind people who enjoy delivering impact and growing the business together!
 * Growth ‚Äì both business and individual. We try to build product and data science culture within the company, including regular data science or data engineering talks and presentations. üçï
 * Flexibility to find your work-life balance - We understand that nine to five doesn't fit for all. We have also flexible remote culture and f2f working possibilities. As a company, we are trying to support different type of working, whether it is online or office. This means that teams and team members can choose what is the best way of working for them. As an example, we have fully remote employees and those, who like to work from the office on daily basis. Of course, your opinion matters!
 * Benefits, such as healthcare,‚ÄØlunch and activity benefits, full holidays‚ÄØfrom the start of your employment‚ÄØ(5 weeks/year), phone and other working equipment,‚ÄØoption program, and home care services in case of sick children.

Doctoral researcher to work on Materials Engineering for Efficient Green Ammonia Production

Join us in this challenging endeavour of developing the key materials and methods for green transition! Ammonia is one of the most produced compounds in the world (~150 million tons per year), and a vital raw material for various important substances, such as fertilizers. It is also a promising green hydrogen carrier and zero-carbon fuel. Currently, ammonia is produced by energy-hungry Haber-Bosch synthesis using fossil-originated hydrogen. Lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction (LiNR) has demonstrated significant promise in ambient-condition electrochemical ammonia synthesis. LiNR, however, still has poor efficiency due to unstable materials and lack of understanding for rational engineering approach. This project will fill these gaps and precisely tailor the materials through atomic layer deposition (ALD) and investigate them with advanced characterization methods. The main aim is to obtain fundamental understanding of the role of solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) and optimize the materials for efficient LiNR, contributing towards efficient electrochemical ammonia production and realization of a carbon-neutral society.

Your role and goals

This position is part of the doctoral school of Aalto Hydrogen Innovation Center, which will be supported by common seminars, networking activities and contact with industry.

We are now looking for a

Doctoral researcher in next-generation inkjetable materials

The research will be in the framework of the project ""3D-GRINO-PPCI, 3D Graded Index Optics Printed using Photocurable Inks"". 3D-GRINO-PPCI will deliver locally optimized polymeric materials with designed gradient compositions to tailor the performance of the optical systems well beyond the capabilities of today's technologies. We will present a groundbreaking opportunity to replace conventional optical lenses, where material interface (form) refracts light rays, with lenses with parallel tailored refractive index distribution (graded-index GRIN), which makes it possible for the optical rays also to bend inside the optical elements. Although freeform optics have already been introduced and simple geometrically symmetric GRIN optics are possible to manufacture ‚Äì separately ‚Äì our unique multi-material 3D printing technology will enable simultaneous control of form and GRIN structure with accuracy, flexibility, and functionality never seen before. We will also develop optical design algorithms that will benefit from the researched materials and be able to optimize optical systems for a much smaller number of elements than ever before. One key element of the new algorithms is 'Micro-correction of Chromatic Aberration', which keeps all colors of white light traveling together by proper choice of newly developed photocurable ink materials with respect of the refractive indices and the Abbe numbers.

The 3D-GRINO-PPCI is a Research Council of Finland Consortia Funding between Aalto University and the University of Eastern Finland. For one of the working packages, we are seeking a highly motivated doctoral researcher to join our innovative project focused on developing next-generation inkjetable and rapidly photocuring polymeric materials for optical applications. This project aims to advance the field of optical materials by creating formulations that enable precise voxel-by-voxel manufacturing of 3D structures with pre-defined refractive index gradients.

Your role and goals


 * Design and synthesize novel photocurable oligomeric precursors, polymeric resins, and polymer composites with varying refractive indices.

Lattice materials are interconnected arrays of struts, like honeycombs, and they possess remarkable properties: they are among the stiffest, strongest, and lightest materials available today. Lattices have a major advantage over conventional engineering materials: their topology can be designed to achieve new and unique combinations of mechanical properties. The objective of this project will be to tailor the architecture of lattices to increase their resistance to crack propagation. To achieve this, you will perform a wide range of finite element simulations and validate these predictions with mechanical tests on lattices produced by additive manufacturing. The position is fully funded by a Research Council of Finland project led by assistant professor Luc St-Pierre.

Your Experience

The call is open for candidates with a MSc degree in civil or mechanical engineering, applied physics, or a related discipline. A strong background in structural and solid mechanics is necessary, and prior knowledge of fracture mechanics is prefereable. In addition, experience with finite element simulations is highly desirable, especially with the Python scripting interface of the software Abaqus.

What We Offer

The starting salary of a doctoral researcher is about 2700 ‚Ç¨/month (gross), with possible increases based on achievements. The annual workload is currently 1612 hours. The employment contract includes occupational health care, and Finland has a comprehensive social security system. The first contract will be made for 2 years, with a 2-year extension after passing the midterm review.

Topics

Machine learning foundations

Keywords: probabilistic modelling, Bayesian inference, simulation-based / likelihood-free inference, multi-agent RL and collaborative AI, sequential decision making and experimental design, privacy-preserving learning, Bayesian deep learning, generative models

We are looking for a new postdoc in the team which develops probabilistic modelling and Bayesian inference methods. The team has several exciting new machine learning formulations we work on, and opportunities for applying the methods with top-notch collaborators. The core is always development of new methods, and with this call we are looking for talented researchers with background in machine learning, stats or CS (or other directly relevant topics) who are keen on developing the new methods. In the cover letter, let us know what you are interested in - if we are already working on it, all the better, but we are willing to listen to new ideas too.

Machine learning for drug design

Keywords: probabilistic modelling, generative models, drug design, molecular modelling, deep learning

Recent progress in machine learning for generative and predictive models of molecules brings us towards computational, automatised drug design. We develop statistical methods and models for molecular structures, energies and interactions with the help of deep learning. A number of open problems reside in developing neural network models with physics-based inductive biases, in generative models in 3D spaces, in modelling the property landscapes of molecules, and in generalizing outside the training distribution in molecular design.

We are looking for motivated candidates with background in computational sciences, machine learning, statistics. Stong interest in drug design is necessary, prior experience a big plus.

Team: this position is in the Probabilistic Machine Learning (PML) research group at Aalto, https://research.cs.aalto.fi//pml and will involve collaboration with Prof. Vikas Garg (https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/vikas-kumar-garg) and Dr Markus Heinonen.

Machine learning for synthetic biology and biodesign

Keywords: AI-based design, human-in-the-loop machine learning, collaborative AI, molecular modeling, reinforcement learning, deep learning algorithms, generative models

We are searching for early career scientists to join our research team working towards next-generation machine learning methods for synthetic biology. The position is available in a new large multi-year project, the Virtual Laboratory for Biodesign (BIODESIGN), implemented in collaboration between FCAI and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.

Supported by a 2 million EUR grant from the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation, the BIODESIGN project aims for breakthroughs in AI techniques for protein design by combining the strength of novel deep learning models with AI-based design and human feedback in a Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle. The virtual laboratory is envisioned to have wide-range applications in industry (e.g., new biochemicals, biomaterials and drugs) and to help the transition to a carbon-neutral society.

We are looking for applicants with a strong academic record in computer science, mathematics, or statistics. Solid research experience in one or more of the following fields is beneficial: AI-based design, Deep learning algorithms, Generative models, Human-in-the-loop machine learning, Collaborative AI, Molecular modeling, Reinforcement learning, Structured prediction.

We invite applications from early-career scientists at levels of Postdoctoral researcher and Research fellow.

The successful applicants will join a world-class research team where top AI researchers in FCAI (led by Professors Samuel Kaski, Juho Rousu and Vikas Garg) join forces with synthetic biology experts of VTT (led by Prof. Merja Penttil√§).

Team: this project will involve collaboration with Prof. Juho Rousu (https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/juho-rousu) and Prof. Vikas Garg (https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/vikas-kumar-garg).

Deep learning with differential privacy

Keywords: Deep learning, hyperparameter learning, differential privacy

Differential privacy allows developing machine learning algorithms with strong privacy guarantees. Recent work shows it is possible to combine strong privacy and high accuracy by pre-training models on public data and only fine-tuning the model with the sensitive data. However, high accuracy still requires a few key problems to be solved. The aim of this project is to develop methods that make it easier to train high accuracy private models. The project will benefit from a very large grant of compute time on LUMI, 3rd fastest supercomputer in the world. The project requires a background in deep learning.

Team: this project will involve collaboration with Prof. Antti Honkela (https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahonkela/).

Machine learning for personalized medicine

Keywords: Causal inference, differential privacy, graph neural networks, user models

We are looking for postdocs to join our research team working towards new machine learning methods for personalized medicine. The fundamental machine learning challenges underlying modern data-based personalized medicine stem from the discrepancy that individual healthcare decisions need to be personalized to an individual, whereas any data-driven model needs to generalize over a larger set of individuals.

This project utilizes unique datasets such as the FinRegistry research project (www.finregistry.fi), which combines data across 18 registries covering the Finnish population's healthcare visits, medications and socio-demographics for 7.2 million individuals. Patient data is characterized by limited data availability determined by how frequently a patient interacts with the healthcare system, and heterogeneity in the disease phenotypes being predicted. By developing new meta-learning methods for this data, we aim to address how risk assessments and treatments can be improved. This requires new approaches that learn from relational data (e.g., population-scale family networks and doctor-patient networks), while respecting data privacy and accounting for user models and distribution shift.

We are looking for applicants with a strong academic record in computer science, mathematics, or statistics. Solid research experience in one or more of the following fields is beneficial: meta-learning, causal inference, user models, distribution shift, differential privacy, graph neural networks.

Team: this project will be carried out with collaborators at the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (led by Associate Professor Andrea Ganna), Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare (led by Professor Markus Perola), and the Christabel Pankhurst Institute at the University of Manchester.

Real-time AI-assistance with computationally rational user models

Keywords: collaborative AI, human-in-the-loop ML/RL, reinforcement learning, user modelling

Despite recent advances in AI and machine learning, there are few AI solutions that can be applied when we cannot precisely specify the objective or do not have suitable data to learn from. This is particularly salient and challenging in ad hoc assistance for human users in complex tasks such as scientific discovery.

This project aims to address this issue by learning these objectives, and to assist, directly from interaction with the users. To do so, we develop reinforcement learning techniques for AI-assistants and computationally rational user models that take into account factors such as cognitive biases to reason about human decision-making. We push state-of-the-art in AI that, through inference over - and planning with - such user models, is able to tackle problems that are otherwise out of reach of mainstream AI solutions.

Supported by a High-performance computing grant from the Research Council of Finland, we are looking to strengthen this team with postdocs with a strong academic record in computer science, mathematics, or statistics. Solid research experience in one or more of the fields listed under this topic is beneficial.

Team: this project will be carried out with a top expert on computational rationality, Prof. Andrew Howes of University of Exeter, and experts in application domains.

Next generation distribution shifts

Keywords: distribution shift, out-of-distribution generalization, robust deployment, deep learning, experimental design

Robust algorithms for machine learning models are vital as the deployed scenario can differ from the training scenario in unexpected ways. Placing assumptions on the kind of distribution shift we expect, such as covariate or label shift, and accounting for it during training is common practice. However, these assumptions are often too restrictive for real-world settings, as the shifts encountered are typically more complex. Moreover, it is difficult to know a priori which shifts we need to account for. This project focuses on developing novel machine learning methods that demonstrate robust performance by adapting to unforeseen shifts and diverse datasets during deployment.

We are looking for applicants with a strong academic record in computer science, mathematics, or statistics. Solid research experience in one or more of the following fields is beneficial: distribution shift, out-of-distribution generalization, out-of-domain generalization, sequential experimental design.

Your Experience And Ambitions

We expect the candidates to hold or be close to getting a relevant doctoral degree and have a solid background in the mathematics/statistics/computer science needed in machine learning.

Previous experience in the application fields is an advantage. Capability of both independent work and teamwork, and excellent written and spoken English are necessary.

Most of our work is backend heavy (Python) but as with all the small teams we appreciate broad set of skills. If you have skills and interests to work with frontend and data, great!

Are you excited about energy ecosystem transforming to zero-carbon era? Do you enjoy developing new solution concepts from idea stage to pilot installations to full-scale commercial launch? Can you see what should be technically feasible and progress towards that by iteratively removing the largest uncertainties first building high quality code? Can you conquer complex problems by dividing them into easier to track sub-components, and keep stakeholders involved on where the current priorities are?

The easiest analogy of what we‚Äôre building is to think of connecting thousands of Tesla powerwalls into a virtual powerplant. Read more about our project to use telecom towers to build a more energy-efficient future.

We are functioning like a startup within the larger Elisa corporation, proving that it is truly possible to combine the perks of a lean startup business with the resources and financial stability of a corporation. As we are growing fast and changing all the time, you will have a great chance to evolve the role yourself.

What the role is all about?

You will be designing and implementing software and systems to build up a comprehensive and high-quality distributed system in the technical domain of Smart Energy Solutions.

Most of our team is based in Helsinki (some in Tampere and Turku), but like the rest of the elisians, we can work flexibly (in Southern Finland).

Why join us?

You will be given a large portion of responsibility, but equal amounts of freedom and trust. We‚Äôre a small team of 10+ engineers working on a new disruptive solution to the energy markets ‚Äì a true startup but inside Elisa.

Elisa has been ranked as one of the Finland's best employers for many years, for many reasons: huge amounts of flexibility, a friendly and laid-back working environment, great leadership that we are truly proud of, a continuous curiosity and an innovative aim to develop, as well as a fundamental invitation to come as you are.

Our international community consists of 100+ designers, developers and consultants based in Helsinki and Stockholm. We've been rocking the industry for 16 years now. We are not a typical top-down corporation, but an inclusive work community where individuals can affect how we roll.




Are you the one, a new Qvikie?

At Qvik, we hire talented people that are more than a pair of coding hands.This means that, besides coding amazing software, you have the ability to discuss the best technology choices and solutions with clients, including in the sales phase of a project. We take pride in our work, have the curiosity to take our personal development to the next level, and want to share our know-how with our colleagues. We want to see the same kind of spark in you.

DOCTORAL RESEARCHER

in urban meteorology starting earliest in November 2024 in a fixed term contract of 3,5 years.

Background

Cities worldwide are increasingly interested in harnessing the potential of urban vegetation to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While existing research has primarily focused on carbon sequestration, the exchange of other GHGs and the role of soils have been widely neglected. Studies indicate that biogeochemical cycles of vegetation and GHG exchanges undergo alterations in urban settings compared to natural ecosystems, driven by specific urban features such as fertilization, irrigation, pollution and changes in soil physical condition. These processes are not well understood in urban settings. The Research Council of Finland funded GHUGS ( GreenHouse gas dynamics of Urban Green Space ) project aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of atmosphere-plant-soil GHG dynamics in urban areas and practical insights for urban planning practices to mitigate natural urban GHG emissions. The project integrates novel ecosystem level, tree ecophysiological and soil measurements with satellite observations and process-based modelling.

The doctoral researcher will be working with the comprehensive observations collected during the project. The observations cover ecosystem level eddy covariance measurements, soil and shoot chamber measurements, and tree-level sap flux measurements collected in different cities. The researcher will actively participate on observations

The doctoral researcher will work as part of the urban meteorology group at INAR , led by Prof. Leena J√§rvi. The group studies urban atmosphere, air quality and greenhouse gas cycle using a wide range of methodologies including eddy covariance technique, land surface modelling and large eddy simulation. The work will be done in close collaboration with Finnish Meteorological Institute.

Doctoral researcher position

We are seeking a talented and motivated doctoral researcher (PhD student), who recently completed their MSc degree in the field of Physics, Meteorology, Forest Sciences, Geography, or any other similar area. MSc students near the completion of their degree are also encouraged to apply.

The candidate should have:


 * Willingness to pursue a PhD degree in meteorology
 * Good skills in written and spoken English
 * Some previous experience in programming (e.g., R or Python) and statistical analysis of scientific data. Previous experience from working with GHG observations (e.g. eddy covariance, chamber, sap flux) is an advantage
 * Interest in doing research on close to the project scope and ability to independent creative thinking, combined with good
 * self-discipline and reasonable communication skills.

The position is funded by the Research Council of Finland project entitled ‚ÄòHeatwave-driven rewiring of coastal food webs`. The overarching aim of this project is to predict how coastal ecosystems respond to marine heatwaves, a common feature of climate change and one of the most pervasive threats to marine biodiversity globally.

Postdoctoral researcher in experimental and molecular food web ecology

The postdoctoral project will contribute to developing a framework for predicting the rewiring of coastal food webs exposed to heatwaves. This will be achieved through a combination of approaches: mesocosm experiments, DNA sequencing, and food web modeling.

Mesocosm experiments are valuable because they can mimic the complexity of natural ecosystems, enabling us to unravel how these complex systems might respond to future environmental conditions. Metabarcoding, on the other hand, offers high taxonomic resolution in revealing who feeds on whom (both prokaryote and eukaryote) within a community. The modeling component of the project will integrate the metabarcoding outputs from the experiments into a bioenergetic food web model to quantify ecosystem functioning and stability.

Specifically, we aim to:


 * Quantify shifts in species dietary preferences under climate warming and resource availability scenarios.
 * Analyze trophic rewiring in mesocosm food webs under heatwave scenarios.
 * Assess the implications of these changes for coastal ecosystem functioning and stability.
   
   
   

This novel methodological framework, which combines aquatic mesocosm experiments with metabarcoding and food web modeling, will provide a mechanistic understanding of how coastal ecosystems respond to rapidly intensifying heatwaves. The insights gained from this research are critical for managing and safeguarding our coastal marine ecosystems.

The focus of the specifics of the research questions and the experimental setup will be developed jointly with the candidate, largely driven by the candidate‚Äôs research profile and interest.

Position Requirements


 * A completed Ph.D. in Molecular Ecology, Environmental Microbiology , Experimental Community Ecology, Food Web Ecology, or a related field

The principal investigator (PI) of the project is Associate Professor Johanna Eklund. The project aims to provide insight into what are the enabling factors needed to attain sustainable conservation outcomes for protected areas in the long term. The project will use expert elicitation techniques to engage with local stakeholders and experts and identify what they perceive as important in implementing successful conservation policies. The work will include identifying both remote factors (such as institutional constraints) and proximate factors (actions directly related to protected areas). The project uses novel attribution methods, previously not used in conservation science, to explore causalities. The analytical framework will build on a Qualitative Comparative Analysis ‚Äì allowing to study how certain factors in their specific combinations with other factors influence an outcome and will require defining and framing the candidate conditions, their thresholds, and the truth tables of the method in collaboration with local protected area stakeholders and experts.

Responsibilities As a Grant Funded Postdoctoral Researcher

The appointed researcher will lead one of the planned working packages of the project and this will entail to design the data collection, conduct stakeholder focus groups and workshops, to analyze data using a Qualitative Comparative Analyses framework, and publish the findings in high level journals in the field. The position will require familiarity analyzing both qualitative and spatial quantitative data (GIS, focus groups, interviews, workshops), but the work will be supported by a part time research assistant.

Requirements And Eligibility Criteria

The postdoctoral researcher must have a doctoral degree in conservation science, geography, policy analysis, or a related field. It is expected that applicants have experience with mixed-methods and working with both qualitative and quantitative data and analysis.

The project will be done in close collaboration with Professor Tero Heikkil√§ (University of Jyv√§skyl√§).

Your role and goals

The research will focus on new frontiers of quantum geometric superconductivity such as non-equilibrium and dynamical phenomena in flat bands and includes collaboration with experimentalists. The goal is to understand how supercurrent and dissipative currents behave in flat band systems and in presence of quantum geometry, under non-equilibrium conditions. We are expecting to discover novel fundamental behavior and phenomena, as well as give predictions for non-equilibrium experiments and new generation of superconducting devices.

There are possibilities for research collaboration and extended visits to the following partners of the Simons Collaboration and their institutions: Andrei Bernevig (Princeton University), Kristjan Haule (Rutgers University), Miguel Marques (Ruhr University Bochum) and Andrew Millis (Columbia University and Flatiron Institute). There are also other postdoc positions available within the Simons Collaboration, see here. The research involves close collaboration with experimentalists of the SuperC collaboration, particularly Dmitri Efetov and Milan Allan (LMU Munich) and Pertti Hakonen (Aalto University).

We search for a Postdoctoral Researcher with strong analytical skills and experience in quantum many-body theory, preferably in the fields of superconductivity, quantum geometry, quantum transport and/or topological physics. Experience on linear response theory and Keldysh techniques is highly appreciated. Expertise on numerical methods such as dynamical mean-field theory, quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, density-functional theory, non-equilibrium methods and/or machine learning is an additional bonus.

The Quantum Dynamics group led by P√§ivi T√∂rm√§ has pioneered the idea that quantum geometry and topology allows supercurrent and superconductivity in flat bands where non-interacting particles are localized (Peotta and T√∂rm√§, Nature Communications 6, 8944 (2015)). Recently these concepts have become relevant for instance in the context of flat band superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (T√∂rm√§, Peotta, Bernevig, Nature Reviews Physics 4, 528 (2022). Tero Heikkil√§ is a pioneer in flat band superconductivity, especially on the potential of this mechanism to increase the critical temperature (Phys. Rev. B 83, 220503(R) (2011) - High-temperature surface superconductivity in topological flat-band systems (aps.org)). He is also an expert in superconducting (nano)electronics and related non-equilibrium phenomena (Rev. Mod. Phys. 90, 041001 (2018) - Colloquium: Nonequilibrium effects in superconductors with a spin-splitting field (aps.org)).

Your Experience And Ambitions

We are looking for a bright and motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with an excellent record in the field of the position. Good command of English (both verbal and written) and demonstrated ability to disseminate scientific results are mandatory requirements for the position. Finnish language is not required. Applicants must be motivated to conduct research at the highest international level.

Postdoctoral Researchers must hold a PhD degree in a suitable field. Also, researchers that are finishing their PhD within a few months may apply.

What We Offer

Your location will be Aalto University, Finland. You will visit University of Jyv√§skyl√§ a few times per year. Extended visits of several weeks to the other institutions mentioned above are possible and will be arranged according to your wishes.

Aalto University follows the salary system of Finnish universities. The salary ranges for a postdoc from 4020‚Ç¨ to 4420‚Ç¨ per month, depending on previous experience, and the postdoc contracts will initially be made for 2 years. The contract includes Aalto University occupational healthcare.

Place and infrastructure

You will join the QD group at Aalto University. The QD group explores quantum many-body physics theory, with focus on superconductivity, quantum geometry and topology, and also conducts nanophotonics experiments with Bose-Einstein condensation and topological physics themes. Computational facilities available for the project are outstanding, and completely free of charge. Aalto University has its own cluster, and the computational infrastructure and services of the national scientific computing centre CSC are available. For instance last year, their LUMI supercomputer ranked fifth in speed in the TOP500 list of supercomputers and is the fastest supercomputer in Europe.

For recent research outputs of the groups, please see P√§ivi T√∂rm√§‚Äôs entry at Google Scholar, and Tero Heikkil√§‚Äôs entry at Google Scholar.

Aalto University has six schools with nearly 13 000 students and 400 professors. It is the largest university in Finland focusing on education and research and technology, science, business, and arts.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER ON Philosophy of Loneliness. Phenomenological Inquiries into the Social and Affective Dimensions of Experiencing a Lack of Meaningful Connection

‚ÄØ‚ÄØ ‚ÄØ

for a fixed term period for the duration of 2 years, starting in March 2025 or as agreed.

This position is part of a Research Council of Finland project awarded to Research Fellow Sanna Tirkkonen (Principal Investigator) for a project on philosophy of loneliness.

THE PROJECT

The research project Philosophy of Loneliness: Phenomenological Inquiries analyzes loneliness through philosophical means. Today, loneliness is recognized as a serious social problem and a specific form of emotional distress, studied within a multidisciplinary field of research. However, the renewed interest among philosophers in loneliness has brought to light the complexity and diversity of the phenomenon. Some researchers have defined loneliness as an emotional experience of absence, others as an existential feeling, and some as an overarching experiential structure that frames the possibilities of perceiving oneself, others, and one‚Äôs lived reality. In addition, critical approaches have emphasized the importance of shifting the focus from the individual to social structures and harmful environments that contribute to loneliness.

The Philosophy of Loneliness project develops a new research paradigm at the intersection of philosophical studies of loneliness, critical phenomenology, and the philosophy of emotion. This framework is particularly useful for analyzing how experiences of loneliness are shaped by social interactions. The project addresses questions such as: In what sense is loneliness a socially embedded phenomenon? How does loneliness emerge in specific types of interaction? How are socially shaped, normative expectations of relationships present in experiences of loneliness? In this context, the project also explores the experiential links between loneliness and antagonistic emotions such as anger, misogyny, and hatred. What types of emotional environments and social dynamics are involved when loneliness accumulates into hostile emotions? The developed framework thus challenges individualistic conceptions of loneliness and promotes more nuanced, critical ways of understanding and analyzing the phenomenon.

THE CANDIDATE

The postdoctoral researcher working on this project is expected to have a doctoral degree in philosophy with a specialisation in relevant areas (e.g. phenomenology, post-structuralism, hermeneutics, existentialism, enactivism, philosophy of emotions, social/critical theory, or political philosophy). It will also be considered an advantage if the applicant possesses relevant knowledge and skills for building bridges between philosophy and other fields of loneliness research, such as the history of emotions, psychology, psychotherapy, literary studies, political science, gender studies, or media studies. Other areas of research will also be considered.

The default assumption is that the doctoral degree requirement must be met by the beginning of the employment. The period following the completion of doctoral degree must not exceed three years, excluding family leave and equivalent periods of absence. Applicants must have strong skills in philosophical writing and an excellent command of written and spoken English.

‚ÄØ

Successful applicants will demonstrate excellent methodological and academic writing skills. Strong organizational skills are required in order to plan and conduct work independently. As the postdoctoral researcher will work as part of a project and with students, it is essential that applicants demonstrate good communication skills.

Responsibilities

The main task of the appointed researcher is to coordinate and conduct philosophical research. The post-doctoral fellow will play a pivotal role in project implementation individually and jointly. In addition, the researcher will actively contribute to teaching and administrative tasks in the discipline of Practical Philosophy at the University of Helsinki (up to 5% of their working time annually) and participate in organizing a conference on the topic. It is possible to complete the teaching and administrative tasks through English.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER on Understanding and redefining just sustainability transformations from queer perspectives

for a fixed term period for the duration of 3 and half years, starting in January 2025 or as agreed.

This position is part of an ERC Consolidator Grant awarded to Associate Professor Guido Caniglia (Principal Investigator) for the project: ‚ÄúWhose sustainability? Understanding and redefining just sustainability transformations from disability and queer perspectives‚Äù (WEIRD) (see further information below).

By foregrounding and leveraging disability and queer perspectives around environmental sustainability, WEIRD aims to (a) critically appraise the way in which we usually think about sustainability transformations, (b) empirically understand how people with disability and from gender and sexual minorities are enacting and prefiguring alternative, just, and more environmentally sustainable futures, and (b) creatively redefine and generate new theories of justice in sustainability transformations (see: TOPIC and OBJECTIVES below for more details). The research design of the project is organized in two main tracks: the first looking at the intersection of environmental sustainability and disability and the second investigating the intersection of environmental sustainability and queer (see: APPROACH AND RESEARCH DESIGN below for more details).

Responsibilities

The postdoctoral researcher will have to be able to engage actively and creatively with the complex inter and transdisciplinary design of the project as well as to conduct empirical and theoretical work (see: APPROACH AND RESEARCH DESIGN below for more details). Under the guidance and direction from the Principal Investigator, the postdoctoral researcher will be in charge of conducting research in the queer track of WEIRD as well as to coordinate synergies with the disability track of the project. The main tasks for the researcher over the three and half years years duration of the contract will be:


 * First, to lead an interdisciplinary literature review about the intersection of queer justice and environmental issues.
 * Second, to design and implement the empirical investigation of one initiative or a series of initiatives that engage with environmental issues in transformative ways from queer perspectives.
 * Third, to work on the theoretical synthesis of the results from the empirical investigations towards the redefinition of just sustainability transformations from queer perspectives.
 * Fourth, to scope, map, and collect initiatives at the disability and queer environmental intersection globally for the development of an Atlas of disability and queer environmental initiatives around environmental sustainability.
 * Fifth, to contribute to the development of ethical and methodological principles and guidelines for disability and queer (transformative) environmental research.
   
   
   

Over the course of the three years, the researcher will also be able to develop their own line of investigation about the intersection of queer and sustainability justice. They will do so from their own specific disciplinary background and interest (e.g., from the perspective of environmental philosophy or political ecology).

In addition, the researcher will actively contribute to teaching, PhD supervision within WEIRD, and administrative tasks in the discipline of Social and Public Policy at the University of Helsinki (up to 5% of their working time annually). It is possible to complete the teaching and administrative tasks in English.

Qualifications

An appointee to the position must hold a doctoral degree in one of the environmental humanities (e.g., environmental ethics, philosophy of science, environmental history) or in one of the environmental social sciences (e.g., ecological economics, environmental sociology, political ecology). The appointed researcher will also have a strong motivation to develop their profile more at the interdisciplinary intersection with queer or gender studies.

The default assumption is that the doctoral degree requirement must be met by the beginning of the employment. The period following the completion of doctoral degree must not exceed three years, excluding family leave and equivalent periods of absence. Applicants must have strong theoretical interests, qualitative methods skills and an excellent command of written and spoken English.

Essential Qualities And Attributes

Overall, the post-doctoral researcher will have:


 * strong theoretical and philosophical knowledge and skill.
 * experience in qualitative, mixed-methods research (or willingness to strengthen this methodological skill).
 * Capacity to work collaboratively in a diverse and interdisciplinary research group.
 * Ethical sensitivity and competence to work with vulnerable populations and minorities.
   
   
   

Successful applicants will demonstrate excellent methodological and academic writing skills. Strong organizational skills are required in order to plan and conduct fieldwork independently as well as to contribute to the organization and facilitation of workshops. As the postdoctoral researchers will also be working as a team with other researchers, including PhD students, it is essential that applicants demonstrate excellent collaboration and communication skills.

A major adagio of the Sustainable Development Goals is ‚ÄúLeave no one behind‚Äù implying that actions addressing the sustainability challenges of our time should not be only ecologically beneficial, but also emancipatory for the most vulnerable and marginalized. Yet, many vulnerable and marginalized groups are often left behind in sustainability research and actions. Despite the increasing engagement of disabled and queer scholars and societal actors for environmental and climate justice, their voices are rarely considered in research and action on sustainability transformations. Using an inter and transdisciplinary approach, this project aims to understand and redefine the often-neglected contributions of disability and queer scholarship and societal initiatives around sustainability towards new theories, methodologies, and ethics of just and emancipatory sustainability transformations. WEIRD will: (1) overcome the fragmentation of disability and queer scholarship around sustainability; (2) explain how disability and queer societal initiatives contribute to just sustainability transformations by subverting ableistic and cis/heteronormative social norms; (3) develop new theories of emancipatory sustainability transformations that rely on subversive social norms; (4) generate new transformative methodologies in sustainability science; (5) redefine transformative justice for sustainability and the ethics of sustainability science.This project is groundbreaking because it will generate new theories, methodologies and ethics to systematically integrate issues of justice and emancipation in the study of sustainability transformations that are anchored in, but not limited to, disability and queer perspectives. Overall, through the synergistic achievement of all its objectives, WEIRD will enhance the potential of sustainability science to generate new knowledge about and for just sustainability transformations.

Approach and research design of the project

The research design of the project is organized in two main tracks: the first looking at the intersection of environmental sustainability and disability and the second investigating the intersection of environmental sustainability and queer. Both tracks are highly interdisciplinary as it engages in integrated ways with different academic disciplines. WEIRD is situated in the emerging field of transformative and transdisciplinary sustainability science includes approaches, for example, from the environmental humanities, political ecology, philosophy of science, science and technology studies, social-ecological system research and many more. Furthermore, as WEIRD explicitly engages issues of justice, emancipation, and transformation from disability and queer perspectives, it also engages with disability studies, queer studies and gender studies. The project also has transdisciplinary elements as it will involve practitioners, activists, researchers and societal actors from the sustainability, disability and queer communities towards the co-creation of new theories and methodologies.

The two tracks of the project also combine theoretical and empirical elements. The initial and final phases of the project are more theoretical. At the beginning, most work is going to be about scoping and synthetizing existing works at the intersection disability studies and queer studies, respectively, with environmental sustainability. In the final stages, the synthesis and theoretical integration of insights will also require theoretical engagement. The middle phases of the project aim to empirically understand the wide variety of initiatives and experiences that people with disabilities and people from gender and sexual minorities are engaging with to enact, envision, and rethink sustainability transformations that engage with disability and queer justice as well as with environmental sustainability.

Doctoral Researcher in Boreal peatlands

starting earliest in November 2024 in a fixed term contract of 3 years.

Background

Boreal peatlands store vast amounts of carbon and are important carbon sinks that help mitigate global warming. Increasing drought in the boreal zone threatens these carbon sinks as limited water availability can drastically reduce plant production. The water use strategies of boreal peatland plants in response to drought and their impact on peatland production, however, are largely unknown. Therefore, we urgently need to understand the water use of peatland plants and its implications for peatland carbon sink potentials. To address this knowledge gap, our project will assess the drought response of distinct peatland types, i.e., pristine and forestry-drained peatlands.

We will systematically characterize the impact of plant water use strategies on peatland productivity by combining 1) novel in-situ water stable isotope methods and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for process understanding with 2) eddy-covariance carbon and water flux monitoring and multi-sensor remote sensing for vegetation and soil water dynamics. We will integrate our results in a process-based land surface model to provide improved predictions for future carbon emissions of boreal peatlands. The doctoral researcher will work with the extensive observations collected during the project. The observations include novel in situ plant and soil water isotope data, greenhouse gas exchange measurements, as well as ecosystem level eddy covariance measurements, collected at different peatland sites. The doctoral researcher will actively conduct and participate in observations.

The doctoral researcher will work as part of the new Academy of Finland fellowship PeatStress. The position will be located in the micrometeorology group at INAR. The work will be done in close collaboration with the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the German Aerospace Center (Munich, Germany) and University College Dublin (Ireland), including visits to our collaborators.

Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.

We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.

Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.

These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu ‚Äì desktop or server ‚Äì is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.

But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.

We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general.

Since 2008, we at have been building mobile experiences for consumers, e.g. in the fields of media, finance, travel and mobility, and retail. We create digital solutions for millions of end users every day by doing design, development and consultation work with our clients. And not just any clients, but the most desirable ones in the consumer market ‚Äì such as Suunto, S√§√§st√∂pankki, Oura and Kesko, just to name a few.

Our international community consists of 140+ designers, developers and consultants based in Helsinki and Stockholm. We've been rocking the industry for 16 years now. We are not a typical top-down corporation, but an inclusive work community where individuals can affect how we roll.




Are you the one, a new Qvikie?

At Qvik, we hire talented people that are more than a pair of coding hands.

This means that, besides coding amazing software, you have the ability to discuss the best technology choices and solutions with clients, including in the sales phase of a project. We take pride in our work, have the curiosity to take our personal development to the next level, and want to share our know-how with our colleagues. We want to see the same kind of spark in you.




But let's talk about tech. Modestly put, we offer the best possible tech solutions for our B2C customers' needs. To be able to contribute to this, your tech skills should heavily rely on:




Swift / Objective-C and/or Kotlin




Also experience with cross-platform technologies such as Flutter or React Native is considered a plus.




Experience in any other languages, platforms, technologies or environments are a definite plus for you as a future Qvikie. Responsive design and native apps are the things that make you tick. Any apps already in the store will show a good case for your experience. Seniority in leading projects, mastering agile methodologies, and passion for solving multifaceted tech problems is a definite plus. You probably have comprehensive knowledge in a couple of the mentioned languages and frameworks but, more importantly, you have an interest in learning new ones too. Currently, we are searching for pros who are located in Finland, Uusimaa.




The people you work with will be from different backgrounds and have different strengths. This means that we cherish a culture of open-mindedness, equality and empathy toward all people. At the moment, we are reinventing our DEI practices on the company level to make Qvik the best place to work for everyone ‚Äì but there‚Äôs always more work to be done, and we hope that you want to be a part of it.




Oh, those projects

At Qvik, you'll be working in small and autonomous tech teams. Our projects are typically a combination of application and web design and development (hybrid or native), and some APIs in the backend.




You work in our customers‚Äô development teams, usually together with other Qvikies. The end products you are working with are something you can show to your family and friends ‚Äì products you can and want to use yourself. We don‚Äôt deliver off-the-shelf tricks, but build new solutions from scratch to fit our customers' demands. So you will usually work with cutting-edge software and not so much with legacy ‚Äì what could be better than that!




Our offer

We want to care more. We are concentrating on creating an even more inspiring and safe culture, learning by doing, deepening our professionalism, and building an even stronger community.




The salary level in this position will be somewhere between 5,000 ‚Äì6,500 ‚Ç¨/month + bonuses.

Our basic benefits package is also pretty nice: lunch, commuter, culture and sports benefits, and a bike benefit. Obviously, we provide you with the tools of your choice. We also offer occupational health care with extra health insurance, travel and accident insurance and many company-supported sports and hobby opportunities with other Qvikies.




Supporting the Qvikies' health and work-life balance is essential for us. We offer a sick-child care service for smoother sailing over the flu season, as well as personal support for life challenges via the Auntie service. And don't forget the community glue, aka parties ‚Äì we are pretty good at setting up some jams, too :)

As you might have guessed, we are looking for an experienced DevOps expert to join the POP Insurance development team.

¬†

Do you think Dev and Ops are separate things that happen in their own black boxes? In our opinion, this should not be the case, but we strive to build modern solutions without artificial silos. We have a good Dev model, but would you be the latest confirmation of our Ops skills?




If you have a passion for the development and integration of software development and operations, and the ability to see entities and architectures, you may be the person we are looking for. In this role, you will work closely with both software developers and various stakeholders to ensure that development and operational functions run smoothly and efficiently.




Together with the team, you do your part to ensure that the solutions we implement are exported to the cloud efficiently and automatically, that they are run securely and in accordance with the best practices in the industry, and that a surprising hiccup or somersault causes chaos. In addition, you actively participate in the development of information security and the implementation of related DevSecOps principles.




As someone who has a deeper than average understanding of devices, access rights and related magic, you may occasionally find yourself in an IT support role. However, it is not the focus of your role, but rather a nice side hobby, because you feel comfortable helping people in need.

SOFTWARE DESIGNER




Do you feel that the most interesting part of your job is solving new problems? Are you wondering what types of problems you could think about in your work with us? With us, as a software engineer, you get to participate in varied projects. We provide our customers with varying solution sets consisting of up to over a hundred devices for the theater and industrial industries.




Stage technology may be a new field for you and without a touch surface it may be difficult to get access to the solutions that you could think about with us, so here is a practical example:




""There are 6 (1m wide, 5m high) LED walls on one horizontal rail (e.g. stage board 22m long). Each wall has its own control/location information. The task is to make all the walls move together and separately at a speed of 0.1-1m/s so that the displayed image is consistent all the time. Each wall must ""know"" where its neighbors are, which would avoid collisions and be able to speed up/slow down if necessary. The user has the opportunity to program each movement of the wall through the intuitive user interface, and the program must be able to repeat and monitor the movement in real time with an accuracy of a few mm. And of course, all of this is implemented taking into account possible failure situations, such as if for some reason one wall stops in the middle of movement, how will the others react?""




With us, as a software designer, you participate in the product development work that takes place according to the need from the customer and in the planning of the final solution. You prepare the implementation of projects and discuss the implementation with the customer alongside our project manager.

We use C++ as the programming language and Twincat/Codesys as the environment. Your final job description will be shaped by the areas in which you feel you are strongest and which you enjoy doing. The task description can be modified and expanded according to your interests.




You have a technical educational background suitable for the position and possibly a few years of experience in similar tasks, in software or automation design. You want to develop and have an open-minded attitude towards new things and technologies. You do your work carefully and invest in long-lasting solutions. As a person, you are long-term, self-initiative and problem-solving. You have the ability to communicate in English as well.




With us, you get to work as part of a motivated and highly competent work community, where support is always nearby if needed. Our company offers genuinely good employee benefits, from extensive occupational health to comprehensive sports and cultural benefits. We offer a versatile set of tasks, where you will hardly encounter two completely alike working days. You get to solve problems close to the customer and, if you want, see the world. We offer a great framework for self-initiated activities, where you can truly influence and develop your own area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.

For you to succeed with us




It would be good for you to have extensive knowledge of working with data platforms, databases and integration technologies.




Additionally, you would benefit from at least a few years of experience mastering some of the following techniques and tools:




SQL Server

ETL and ELT

SSIS

SSAS

DAX

Power BI

Cloud data warehouses, Azure or similar cloud environments

AI solutions




In short, your responsibilities include managing our data environment, collecting, processing and analyzing raw data, maintaining and developing the infrastructure of the data environment, managing integrations and downloads, as well as describing the integration and information architecture and maintaining documentation.




The most important thing for us is that you have enthusiasm and curiosity to learn new things, you enjoy solving our customers' challenges (maybe sometimes even exceeding and surprising their expectations) and that you see knowledge sharing and good teamwork as the way to success. It is also important to us that you have a genuine desire to take ownership of the themes relevant to your plot and their development, and that you even enjoy being given responsibility - because we are happy to give it. However, you can probably conclude from the job description above that this job does not seem to suit a complete beginner. Although school certificates are not the thing for us, perhaps you have a university degree in, for example, data processing or at least know-how acquired through several years of work experience. Please note that we work mainly in Finnish.




A few words about your future team and our culture




With us, you can join a twenty-person product development team, with Mika as your supervisor. We have quite nice office premises on Mechelininkatu in Helsinki, in Meclu's premises. We like to see each other in the office and thus share our know-how and build our culture, but we trust that you have an eye for the game to look at your workplace according to what makes sense at any given time. As a workplace and as a team, we are currently in the middle of a change in life. Old operating models have been dismantled and we are building a lot of new things starting from processes and our company culture. So a lot is happening on many fronts. Although as a general rule you can focus on your own work tasks, sometimes ad hoc tasks that require flexibility enrich your day. So if you enjoy a very predictable and harmonious work environment, we also offer pace and changing situations.




For us, the glue of work is the experience of working on meaningful things. We are each other's sources of inspiration. Our conscientiousness, competence and skills arouse admiration in each other. We are also precise and hardworking. Fewer seconds slip through our fingers. We even manage to act in the direction of our customers in such a way that we solve their issues without even realizing it.




In the work community, we have a nice ""we spirit"". If any negative aspects should be highlighted, it is said that we organize too many sauna evenings.




Benefits and specs




The position is full-time and the employment relationship is valid until further notice. Your salary will probably be in the range of around 5000-5500 euros. Of course, this depends on your background and experience, and your salary will also look like that. You can work from anywhere at any time, but meetings at the office are also important to us - hopefully for you too. We also have various benefits to offer, such as a lunch benefit, a cultural and sports benefit, and a bicycle benefit. You might also like to know that we comply with the IT service industry collective agreement.




Our application process proceeds as follows:




Our application period ends on Monday 21 October. However, we try to interview applicants already during the application period and move forward nimbly. We hope that you would be able to start with us as soon as possible.




1. If your skills match what we are looking for, Helena or Ville, who is responsible for our HR affairs, will first call you for a short phone interview.




2. First interview round with Helena and your future front person Mika Rajanen.




3. Second interview round with your future team member and Mika.




If it seems that way, it may be that we may also give a small task to be solved for the competence sample, but there is no need to stress about this. We guide you well and give you clear tools to succeed in this.




If you have any questions, call or message Ville on 044 297 4572 / ville@toolonvire.fi

Job description

As a data engineer, you build reporting solutions of different sizes from the source to the user interface. Someone else often makes the reports, but you can also twist them if it seems meaningful. The solutions are designed together with the customer, and depending on the project, the role can vary from top-level scrimmaging with hands in clay to writing SQL. The customer often doesn't know what he wants, so you take a role in your projects, guiding the development work on your own initiative.

 * Benefits: Among other things, lunch, recreation and commuting benefits, good occupational health, leisure accident insurance, flexible working hours and flexible hybrid work
 * Location: Our office is located in Helsinki on the edge of Hakaniemi market. The work may include occasional visits to customers. In this role, you cannot work 100% remotely.




Your days could look like this

You come to the office in the morning and participate in the client's daily. After the Daily, you wonder why all the source data is messed up again. When you're cleaning data, you gossip about the subject to your co-worker, who gossips back about the same thing. Then you build some pipeline-like thing that takes the data with style and skill directly to the customer's data warehouse. In the afternoon, you will think about the best practices for information modeling and data transfer orchestration together with your colleagues. At some point, you also brainstorm ideas with a neighbor to solve data model update problems. To take a break from work, you play ping pong or poker in the office and laugh to yourself when the customer's positive comments feel so good.




We hope from you




 * At least 2 years of experience in Data Engineer tasks, especially in the Azure environment and with the reporting context
 * Experience with ETL/ELT processes and building data pipelines
 * Understanding of data storage and reporting
 * Customer-oriented and self-initiated attitude
 * Problem solving skills
 * Interest in the latest technologies and desire to learn new things
 * Finnish and English language skills
 * Also considered an advantage: experience with Databricks, BI tools (especially Power BI), working with large data masses, and CI/CD and DevOps practices

We are once again looking for new stars of the future to grow into experts in the grocery trade under the wing of our Interational Trainee program. On this trainee trip, you will definitely get a shopping basket of new lessons, colleagues from around the (Lidl) world and memorable travel kilometers in Finland and Germany. As a cherry on top of the trainee period, you will jump into expert tasks according to your area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility at our Espoo head office.




This time we are looking for three future experts for the real estate, logistics and analytics departments of our Head Office. If you have an education suitable for one of these departments, and you have recently graduated or will graduate during the fall of 2024, then we could have a unique opportunity for you to enter an international career and develop towards expert positions. We hope that you could start the position during October or at the latest at the beginning of November 2024, but we agree on the start on a case-by-case basis.




Below you can read more about what the trainee program includes. On the career pages, you can read more about the working day of the respective departments and the structure of the program.




The structure of the international trainee program




The international trainee program consists of three entities, the exact content of which is determined by your own field of orientation. You thoroughly familiarize yourself with the operations of your own department and support the department in daily work and projects. You will also get to know other departments and get a comprehensive picture of our entire company's operations, from the store floor to the head office.




During the trainee program, your location varies within Finland and culminates in a period in Germany, so it is important that you are ready to live in several different locations. In Germany, you will participate in a German language course and expand your knowledge of our company's operations in an internship. The duration of the trainee program is about 1.5 years, and we also take your wishes into account when planning the structure of the program.




After the program




After you graduate from the International trainee program, we guarantee you an interesting and challenging expert position in your target department. During the program, your future job description will be shaped according to your interests and the situation in your department. The understanding and know-how acquired during the trainee program will enable you to succeed in your expert role in the future. Our company offers excellent development and career opportunities, and many of our employees have advanced in their Lidl careers




These are the things we hope for from you




‚Ä¢ University degree. You can be a recent graduate or have already finished your studies a while ago. It is essential that you have gained a perspective on the topics related to the target department through your studies.

‚Ä¢ We will be happy if you have accumulated some work experience in a field corresponding to your education. You may have already taken your first steps into working life, but the most important thing for us is the interest in developing into a professional in the grocery trade.

‚Ä¢ Fluent Finnish and English language skills. Our official working language is Finnish, but you also communicate naturally in English. In the data and AI team, you communicate with your supervisor mainly in English. Knowing the German language is useful, but you can do great without it, as long as you have the enthusiasm to learn the language.

‚Ä¢ Flexibility and willingness to live in different locations during the program. Your suitcase is already packed for new experiences. During the trainee period, it hurts and happens, so you treat changes as opportunities.

‚Ä¢ Willingness to learn. You will get on an interesting journey to the heart of Lidl's business, where there is certainly more to learn than we can even tell you at this stage, but we are here to support you. It is important to us that you take responsibility for your own learning and that your attitude towards new things inspires others as well.

‚Ä¢ Ability to cooperate and team spirit. Our work is done in a good spirit of cooperation. You like to meet new people and network during the program inside the house.

‚Ä¢ Good IT skills. You control the use of Office programs and you are ready to quickly learn new systems. In the Data and AI team, we expect you to be familiar with the Data Scientist tools, and we also hope for knowledge or at least enthusiasm for ML/AI, the python programming language and BI tools. In the logistics department, we want fluent excel skills (e.g. Vlookup and SAM).

‚Ä¢ B driver's license and the opportunity to do mobile work. During the trainee period, you get to visit our different locations and get around the easiest when you can grab a dump truck for your use.






This is all we offer you

‚Ä¢ Permanent employment and a competitive salary. We pay you 3400e/month right from the start of the trainee program. The salary level develops with years of Lidl experience.

‚Ä¢ An interesting and demanding task field in an innovative and international environment. The position offers a broad overview of our company's operations.

‚Ä¢ A permanent job, valuable work experience abroad and good advancement opportunities. Many trainees have progressed in their careers and spent a long time with us. International work rotation is also possible at Lidl. Such opportunities are rarely offered!

‚Ä¢ Support with living arrangements during the trainee program, if the orientation is located further from your home during the program.

‚Ä¢ A personal mentor who has himself completed the International trainee program. Your mentor spars, shares his experiences and gives tips throughout the program. In addition, you have a direct line to HR and, of course, your own immediate supervisor. The program includes regular feedback discussions, the aim of which is to ensure that we have a common direction.

‚Ä¢ Modern working facilities at our head office in Niittykummu, Espoo, flexible working hours and the possibility to work remotely after the initial orientation - we want your work and free time to remain in good balance.

‚Ä¢ As a Lidl member, you get a six percent staff discount in our stores, an e-pass and various partnership benefits. In addition, we organize events for the staff, offer baby packages and support the well-being of Lidl residents with occupational health care. You also get great opportunities to develop your own skills, because we have a comprehensive selection of training courses and we spend 2.5 million euros annually to train our employees.
